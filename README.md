# Personal Finance Mobile Application

This project is a personal finance mobile application built using React Native and Expo.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Expo Go installed on your mobile device. Expo Go is an app that allows you to open up projects that are being served through Expo CLI.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). After installing Node.js, you will have access to the `npm` and `npx` commands.

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/aizatnazran/personal-finance-mobile.git
cd personal-finance-mobile
```


Then, install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Running the Application
To start the application, run the following command in the root directory of your project:
```
npx expo start
```

This command will start the Expo CLI server. You can then open the project on your mobile device by scanning the QR code provided in the terminal using the Expo Go app.
